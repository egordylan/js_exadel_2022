/*
There is a function which counts all vowels in a given string,
but for some reason I don’t work as expected.
Find out the problem and fix it.

const vovelsCounter = (str) => {
      const vovels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
      let counter = 0
      for(letter of str){
         if(vovels.includes(letter)){
             counter = counter + 1
        }
      }
      return counter
}

vovelsCounter('The current directory is AD-123')
expected output → 8
actual output → 7
